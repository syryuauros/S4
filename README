openblas trouble shooting

in nixpkgs openblas default integer size is 32 bit (integer4).
So if we we use openblas then it may cause wrong results or fail.
To use 64 bit integer, we have to use openblasCompat instead of openblas.

so we have to change all openblas referred in our code (flake.nix, default.nix check the commit).

folder error trouble shooting!

There is '.envrc' files in the S4 folder, and it means we need 'direnv' for showing the folder contents.
Install 'direnv' and 'nix-direnv'!! (use configuration.nix or flakes.nix)
